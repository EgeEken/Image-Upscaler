# AI Image Upscaler

I built this web interface using Flask, HTML, JavaScript and CSS. It uses the Hugging Face transformer models to upscale the given images.

### Usage:

To verify that the models and packages are successfully installed, run the imports.py script
```
python imports.py
```
After that, to run the website model, start this script, and then open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ on a web browser
```
python hugging.py
```
